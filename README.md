# Comparing SOFA Score and LSTM in Predicting 48-Hour Mortality in ICU Patients with Sepsis Using MIMIC-III Data

## Definition and Significance

Sepsis is a critical and common condition in Intensive Care Units (ICU). Accurate prediction of mortality within 48 hours can significantly impact patient outcomes. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset, a large, freely available database of de-identified health-related data, provides an invaluable resource for this research.

### Historical Context of Sepsis Study and Prediction

**Traditional Approaches**:

In real-life clinical settings, medical staff detect sepsis through a combination of clinical assessment, monitoring vital signs, laboratory tests, and patient history. The process includes:

1. **Clinical Assessment**:
    - Observing Symptoms
    - Physical Examination
2. **Vital Sign Monitoring**:
    - Continuous Monitoring
    - Use of Early Warning Scores
3. **Laboratory Tests**:
    - Blood Tests
    - Inflammatory Markers
4. **Reviewing Patient History**:
    - Medical and Surgical History
    - Medication and Allergy History
5. **Identifying the Source of Infection**:
    - Imaging Tests
    - Specialized Tests
6. **Application of Sepsis Criteria**:
    - Sepsis-3 Criteria
7. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**:
    - Consultations
8. **Continuous Monitoring and Reassessment**:
    - Dynamic Process
9. **Rapid Response Teams**:
    - Activation for Acute Changes

**Technological Advancements**:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are advanced machine learning models effective for analyzing time-series data, like patient health records, and can be used to predict outcomes by learning from complex data patterns.

### Research Objective

This project aims to compare the SOFA score and LSTM model in predicting 48-hour mortality among ICU patients with sepsis using the MIMIC-III dataset. The goal is to determine the more effective method for early and accurate mortality prediction, which could lead to improved patient care and resource management in ICUs.

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing (Using MIMIC-III)**:
    - Access and preprocess the MIMIC-III dataset, focusing on patients diagnosed with sepsis.
    - Clean and normalize the data, especially handling missing values and selecting features relevant to sepsis and ICU treatments.
2. **SOFA Score Calculation**:
    - Calculate SOFA scores from the relevant MIMIC-III data at ICU admission and periodically thereafter.
3. **LSTM Model Development**:
    - Develop an LSTM model to analyze patient data over time, focusing on features that may impact mortality within 48 hours.
4. **Comparison and Analysis**:
    - Compare the performance of the SOFA score and the LSTM model in predicting 48-hour mortality.
    - Use metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve for evaluation.
5. **Statistical Validation**:
    - Perform statistical tests to assess the significance of the differences in predictive performance between the two methods.
6. **Clinical Relevance Assessment**:
    - Collaborate with healthcare professionals to assess the clinical applicability of the findings.
7. **Ethical Considerations**:
    - Ensure compliance with all ethical standards and data privacy regulations, particularly in the use of patient data from MIMIC-III.

### Practical Usage

1. **Early Warning System**:
    - Real-time Monitoring
    - Decision Support
2. **Customized Patient Care**:
    - Personalized Treatment Plans
    - Dynamic Risk Assessment
